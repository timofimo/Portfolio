<h3 class="introduction">Hi, My name is Timo. Thank you for having a look at my portfolio.</h3>

I'm a graphics programmer studying at IGAD. I've been programming in C++ since high school. I've been playing the latest AAA games since long before that. I decided I wanted to become a game developer a long time ago. Through hard work and a little bit of luck I managed to get where I am today. I'm happy that I get to spend my days doing something that I love to do, everyday.
