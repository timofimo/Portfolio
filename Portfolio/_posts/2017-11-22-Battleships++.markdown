The assignment for my third block at IGAD was to create a game based on the classic board game [Battleships]({{ "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)"}}). The main goal of the block was to teach us OpenGL and to teach us the basics of networking with [RakNet]({{ "http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/"}}). We would be working on the project alone but everyone would be using the same server. The rules of the game where dictated by the logic on the server.

There were problems with the server from the start of the block. I started early creating my own OpenGL renderer. This meant that I had a lot of time to learn new graphics techniques and implement them.Â I didn't start on gameplay or networking until most of the problems with the server were fixed. I still managed to implement most of the gameplay and networking logic but because of bugs in the server a game could never be played to completion.
<h3>My work</h3>
<h4>Custom math library</h4>
The teachers wanted us to implement our own math library. By doing this I learned how to use cross and dot products, "read" matrices and use matrices to take a point from one space to another.

<h4>Deferred renderer</h4>
Early on I decided to go for a deferred renderer instead of a forward renderer. I only had one directional light in the game and I ended up also implementing a forward rendering pass for all the transparent objects I had in the game. It might not have been the best decision but I still learned a lot from doing it.

I found this paper a couple of weeks before the start of the block. I was very interested. When we got the the assignment I immediately knew I wanted to try it out. I used it to render the ocean in my game. This was the first time I ever had problems with floating point precision. It took quite a lot of debugging but the end result was acceptable.

<h4>Cascaded shadow mapping</h4>
{% include slider.html selector="battleships_images" %}
The first time I implemented shadow mapping was also the first time I implemented cascaded shadow mapping. Because of the large draw distances in my game normal shadow maps wouldn't cut it. With all light in the scene coming from a directional light it was an easy decision to go for cascaded shadow mapping. The further improve the result I also implemented PCF soft shadows.

<h4>Screen space reflections</h4>

My implementation had a lot of artifacts and was very slow but it did work. It made the ships look like as if they were in the water and not on top.

<h4>Particle effects</h4>

This was also my first time implementing particle systems. I learned important basics such as that transparent objects have to be rendered back to front and how to make a quad always face the camera.

<h4>RakNet</h4>
This was my first time doing any networking. RakNet made it very easy to get a simple game up and running. To bad we had server problems. Otherwise I'm sure I could have had a working game.
