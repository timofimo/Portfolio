The assignment for my second block in my second year at IGAD was to create three games based on a specific themes, in a single block. We would be working together in groups of 9. With people from multiple disciplines.

The teachers called each game project a marmalade. For all marmelades we would have to come up with our own concept. The theme for the first marmalade wasÂ <strong>Custom controller</strong>.

Our game was called God Complex. It's about an angry God who is stomping the puny villagers beneath his (many) feet! The game and the controller were created in less than two weeks.

I made the controller. A giant cardboard mat with 12 foot sized pressure plates. The pressure plates are layed out the same way as the grid you see on screen. The board is controlled by and Arduino that is connected to the PC through an USB port. I'm not particularly handy and I made some questionable choices when it comes to the materials we used but I'm happy to say that 9 out the 12 pressure plates worked.

We got very positive feedback on our game. People had a lot of fun dancing on our dancing mat.
