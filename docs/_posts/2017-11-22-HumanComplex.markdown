The assignment for my second block in my second year at IGAD was to create three games based on a specific themes, in a single block. We would be working together in groups of 9. With people from multiple disciplines.

The teachers called each game project a marmalade. For all marmelades we would have to come up with our own concept. The theme for the second marmalade was <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>.

Our game was called Human Complex. In essence it's a democracy simulator. You get one proposal after another and you select if you want to accept or decline the proposal. Based on your decisions some parties will love you and other will hate you. You have to try to find the right balance. The game was created in less than 2.5 weeks using Unreal Engine 4.

I made most of the UI and the background systems controlling the base game logic. Making this game in Unreal proved to be more difficult than expected. Again we got very positive feedback on our game.
