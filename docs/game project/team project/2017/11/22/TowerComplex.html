            <p>The assignment for my second block in my second year at IGAD was to create three games based on a specific themes, in a single block. We would be working together in groups of 9. With people from multiple disciplines.</p>

<p>The teachers called each game project a marmalade. For all marmelades we would have to come up with our own concept. The theme for the third marmalade was this image</p>

<p><img src="/Portfolio/assets/images/Tower%20Complex/Theme.jpg" alt="Theme" class="post_image" /></p>

<p>We saw demons and heaven. We interpreted this as fallen angels and Valhalla. Our game is about Vikings trying to get into Valhalla. It’s a 4 player competitive co-op game. You can’t reach Valhalla by yourself. You need the help of the other players but only the first player who reaches Valhalla wins. This combined with very hectic gameplay made our game very enjoyable. Again, we got a lot of positive feedback on our game.</p>

<p>This marmalade I was the scrum master of the group. It didn’t exactly go well but I learned a lot from doing it. Other than that I helped with programming or bug-fixing wherever possible.</p>
