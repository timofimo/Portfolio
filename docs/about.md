<div class="aboutme" style="text-align: center;">
  <p>I'm a graphics programmer studying at IGAD. I've been programming in C++ since high school. I've been playing the latest AAA games since long before that. My main hobby is programming but I also like watching series or movies and I'm interested in cars.</p>
  <p>I like studying and problem solving. Programming is my device for doing that. My main area of interest is graphics programming because I'm fascinated by the power of the GPU.</p>
  <p>I like to be alone but I also like to have fun with my friends and co-workers. I work well in teams and have the skills to lead. Through years of practice I've become very good at reflecting on myself and my work. I know my shortcomings and my strengths and I'm always looking to improve myself.</p>
